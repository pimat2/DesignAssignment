## Game Summary 
The last Elemental Master is a first person shooter/adventure game that is intended for PC. In this game the player will have to master and control 3 different natural elements(Fire, Earth and Air) in order to overcome different challenges.
## Gameplay
The player will have to acquire the three different elements and use them accordingly in order to complete different challenges. Each element will be represented uniquely in terms of visual and sound design but they will also have unique characteristics that the player should use to his advantage in order to complete the aforementioned puzzles. The main interaction with said elements will happen similar ot FPS Games - the player will be able to shoot with said elements(some even having an alternative shot to them). After acquiring a certain element the player will always have it in his arsenal(inventory), allowing him to switch between the three of them according to his needs.
## Story
The player will be put in the shoes of the last Elemental Master(inspiration taken from Avatar: The Last Airbender). A cutscene that can be triggered in the level of the game will set up the narrative. The player is the last hope for humanity. A mysterious spirit(which now resides in the form of a statue at the center of the level) has brought the player to his realm in order to teach him how to control the different elements. After the player has proven his worth(a.k.a completed each of puzzles associated with the elements) the spirit will remove the barrier that is blocking his path so that the player can go back to the Earth realm and fight against the Evil threatening humanity.(a simple narrative setup for the win condition of the level).
## Visual theme of the game
As mentioned above the game is inspired by the Avatar: The Last Airbender series and therefore I choose to look for a thematic similar to the one set in the series when coming up with the visuals for this game. Therefore the visual style of the game features vibrant colors, while the buildings within which the elements reside are built similarly to Eastern temples. Along with that each of the three temples(for each element) is visually and architecturally differentiated from the others, so that the player can easily associate them. 
## Level Design
Initially I went with the idea of creating a linear experience in only one building where the player would have to consecutively complete the three elemental puzzles in order to achieve the win condition. Although this would've let me pace the game in a way that would make the next puzzle more difficult than its predecessor I felt that I wouldn't be able to properly establish the uniqueness of each room when compared to the others. Therefore I decided to go for an open map experience where the three puzzles are situated in different builgins(temples). This not only allowed me to more easily make each temple unique but also gave the player the freedom to tackle the puzzles in his own sequence and in the case where he/she gets stuck on trying to solve one, just move to another and leave said one for later. Naturally I decided to put the object that triggers the narrative sequence in the middle of the level, since that would be the first element that the player sees.
## Layout and Design of the Puzzle
### Fire Puzzle
In the fire temple:
- Limited lighting on the first floor directs attention to the central fire element.
- The first hidden torch hints at the puzzle, and if the player misses it some backtracking may be required.
- Equipping the fire element emits light to aid navigation.
- The second floor reveals an unlit torch, emphasizing the objective.
- Sound effects indicate progress as torches are lit and when the puzzle is completed.
- A hole in the wall hints at the third torch, requiring closer access.
- A differently colored wall signifies interaction, guiding players.
- Striking the wall with the fire element allows access to the third torch and puzzle completion.
### Air Temple
In the air temple:
- The player finds the air element and sees the outlines of the red and green blocks, key elements of the puzzle.
- Basic blocks are positioned next to the red and green blocks, blocking the player's path and hinting at the need to use the air element.
- The player must use the air element to push the blocks and solve the puzzle.
- Outlines of the red and green floor tiles give a hint about the correct solution.
- The puzzle involves moving colored target cubes to their respective locations using pushing or pulling mechanics.
- Distinct particle effects and sound effects differentiate the pushing and pulling actions.
- A sound effect plays when a block is pushed to its designated location.
- A different sound effect signifies puzzle completion when both blocks are in their correct positions in the air temple.
### Earth Temple
In the earth temple:
- The player's attention is drawn to the earth element in the middle of the temple upon entering.
- Stairs behind the earth element guide the player, similar to the fire temple design.
- Vases are placed in the periphery of the player's vision and hold significance for the earth puzzle.
- As the player ascends to the second floor, the vases become more visible, emphasizing their importance.
- The player can use the earth element to shoot and destroy the vases from the second floor.
- Each hit on a vase is accompanied by a corresponding sound effect, indicating successful interaction.
- After destroying all five vases, the same sound effect played upon completion of the previous temples is heard.
After all three puzzles have been completed(in any order) the barrier that is stopping the player from going back to his realm and completing the game is undone.
## Audio Design
Apart from the voiced over narration the other sounds that I implemented in this game are used to increase the engagement of the player and to act as a feedback when he/she succesfully completes a puzzle. Each of the different elements that the player can interact with is distinguished in both visual and audio aspect. "Shooting" an element produces a unique sound effect that is thematically connected to the type of the element(shooting fire will produce a fire SFX etc.) that helps build the engagement and make the player feel like he's really in control of said elements. Additionally sound effects are also produced when the player makes progress and completes the puzzles in the game.
## UI
The only UI that is present in the game in form of a HUD are the control icons showing the player how to use fire, alternate fire and to switch between his elements. Only those are put since the game doesnâ€™t offer anything else in terms of complex mechanics and the movement controls are quite intuitive for anyone who has played games of the genre.
